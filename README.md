# Why Customer Cohort Analysis Matters

Customer cohort analysis helps businesses measure retention (how many customers stay) and churn (how many leave) over time. By grouping customers based on their sign-up date or first purchase, companies can:
- Identify trends: Spot whether newer customers stay longer than older ones.
- Improve retention: Pinpoint when customers typically leave and intervene.
- Optimize marketing: Measure which campaigns bring the most loyal customers.
- Boost revenue: Retaining customers is often cheaper than acquiring new ones.
